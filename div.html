            "I've been doing fashion longer than I did music," Beckham said, 
            introspectively, over a phone call from London just days after 
            her Fall-Winter 2023 show in the French capital.
            Still known by many beyond the fashion world as "Posh Spice," her 
            nickname as one-fifth of the Spice Girls, she is a celebrity gossip 
            site mainstay, with a famous husband, David Beckham, and increasingly 
            well-known children: Brooklyn, who married actor Nicola Peltz in a
             high-profile wedding last year, Romeo, Cruz and Harper.
            Yet, Beckham's brand, launched in 2008, has been warmly 
            supported by the upper echelons of the fashion industry 
            (Anna Wintour is a regular guest at her shows).
            Having shown regularly during New York and London fashion 
            weeks before making her Paris Fashion Week debut last September, 
            she is certainly no fashion novice and her label has long been 
            synonymous with a sexy and streamlined aesthetic — not a far cry 
            from the sharp minis and sleek silhouettes that were so integral 
            to Posh Spice's look, although now rendered in an undoubtedly more 
            grown-up, glamorous way.
            The best celebrity style from Paris Fashion Week
            The fact that her fashion line has existed for so long is notable. 
            While Beckham has received critical praise in her tenure, it's rare 
            for celebrities without formal design training to find success. Even 
            Rihanna's ready-to-wear line, Fenty, backed by the luxury conglomerate Louis
             Vuitton-Moët Hennessy, was shuttered after two years (though, it should be
              noted, Rihanna's beauty brand of the same name is thriving).
